# ToltTech.USBReliabilityDetector

## Description

USB Reliability Detector was created to help diagnose USB device stability issues on Windows computers.  This app takes an 'end to end' approach of observing when devices are removed and added to the device tree, so as to be able to measure the end user impacts of overall usb system instability.

## Installation

XCopy deployment -- e.g. copy the folder onto a computer, no other installation needed.

## Usage

Run ToltTech.USBReliabilityDetector.exe from the copied folder.

Console app prints results to the console and shows a little console spinner to let you know it is working.

Press any key with the console window in focus to exit the app.

App is logging the results to a local file (path is printed in the first line upon launch).

## Project status

Project is complete, do not expect to revisit it.
